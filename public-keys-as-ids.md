Linking Identity to Public Key
==============================
A signature that verifies correctly makes a statement on behalf of the public key that must have been made by someone with knowledge of the associated secret key.

## Make a New Identity
Create new random keypair: pk, sk.

* Public name pk
* The secret key sk lets you "speak" for this identity

## Decentralized Identity Management
Anybody can make a new ID at any time, and they can make as many as required.
