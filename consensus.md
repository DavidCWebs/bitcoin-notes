Consensus
=========
Because Blockchains are _decentralized_, there needs to be a way to ensure that all blocks are the same - that all nodes reflect the same chain.

This is the problem of consensus - and blockchains need to implement some form of consensus algorithm if the network contains more than one node.

Rules:
1. The longest valid chain on the network is the authoritative one - this represents the valid blockchain that should be accepted by all network nodes
2. To add (or mine, forge) a new block to the chain, a node must commit something (e.g. computational power to solve a problem)
